        <h1> Blend's Journey</h1>
        <p><em>Soldier in the 7th Squad of the <strong><a href="https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Bridgeburners">Bridgeburners</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>She was slim with soft brown (or dark) eyes, and her skin tone and the cast of her features was no different from local Daru or Genabarii in Darujhistan. Picker was her lover.
          She was not very talkative by nature and was a perceptive observer. She could see through illusory magic and was a skilled interpreter of tracks.
          Blend wore a small stone around her neck which she had bought from an old desert merchant in Pan'potsun. She said it made it hard for people to focus on her.
          This ability to blend into her surroundings and go unnoticed had resulted in her name. She was unaware that it was a natural talent, not the stone that gave her those advantages.
          Blend used her abilities to gather intelligence, and frequently kept her fellow squadmates informed of what their commanders were thinking and saying.
          Like many Malazan soldiers, her name was bestowed by the legendary Master Sergeant, Braven Tooth. She wore a chain hauberk and carried a matched pair of Wickan longknives
          on a belt that rode low on her hips.</p>
